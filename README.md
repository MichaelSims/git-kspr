# `git kspr` (Git Kasper)

This is a reimplementation of [git spr](https://github.com/ejoffe/spr) written in Kotlin.

## Braindump of plan

- CLI separated from main logic (naturally)
- Use Github's graphql API
  - Create a set of integration tests, but stub the GH API so that it returns actual canned responses, so I can iterate without needing a token or without worrying about the API throttling me
- Mostly achieve feature parity with git spr, but drop things I don't plan to use
- Use JGit instead of the command line
- Tests don't mock git, but actually create a temporary repo to operate on
- Features to add
  - Consider minimizing re-verifications
    - Merging part of the stack currently causes a reverify, for a couple of reasons
      - Reasons
        - It uses the GH API to merge instead of pushing directly, and the GH merge button tends to recreate the commits instead of FF merging them
        - git spr rewrites the descriptions to show that part of the stack has been merged
      - Fixing this would require us to no longer update the descriptions of the remaining commits. Might not be worth it
    - Adding a new commit to a stack causes a reverify
      - This is because of the entire stack being in the description of each commit. Any addition to the stack requires all commits to be updated. We'd have to stop doing this if we wanted to avoid the reverifies
  - Branch cleanup
    - An option to remove the branches for merged PRs
    - A command to interactively clean PRs that you opened (to handle orphaned ones)
  - When determining if a PR is "mergeable", don't use GH's "mergeable" property to determine this. Reason: if the branch protection rules for spr/**/* differ from those of main then GH may think a PR is mergeable when it really isn't. To fix this, we need to determine mergeability by inspecting the branch protection rules
  - Add a tracked Revision to the commit bodies when updating them. Then use this to warn if someone is attempting to kspr update an older version on top of a newer one. This will typically only happen when collaborating w/others on the same stack
  - Add command to list all PR stacks you have opened
- Figure out if there's a way to automate publishing like git spr does
